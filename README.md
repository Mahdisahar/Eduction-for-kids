Education webpage:

Creating a responsive website dedicated to free learning resources for all ages from kindergarten to grade 12 is a fantastic idea.
Divide resources into categories such as Math, Science, English Language, Typing. Display resources in a grid. Include tags for each resource, and Clicking on a resource should lead to a detailed page providing more information.
